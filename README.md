# GymApp

This project is a study project that helped me to learn some Swift and iOS development advanced concepts on UI coding and better UX by implementing a more complex layout and custom animation and transitions. This is a replica app and uses the known domain of a famous gym and wellness company.

> I've already taken some good steps in my journey studying Swift and iOS native development, so this project is expected to meet a little more advanced criteria regarding platform knowledge and general coding with the language, but suggestions for improvement are still very welcome. ðŸ¤— thx.

This project is part of a structured study plan and you can see details below.

## Repo organization

For study purposes this repo uses a feature-branch like pattern. With this we gain in the feature pull requests some space to discuss about the implementation and register lessons learned during the development. Check the pull request's history to take a look at the code of a single feature.
